# Twilio Text Message Bot Coding Challenge 

Your mission should you choose to accept it is to create a text messaging bot using Node.JS that replies to text messages with a MMS picture text message containing a related gif from the Giphy Search API. 

For example, if you were to text the word "pizza" the bot would reply with something like this:

When you are done push your code to GitHub and the phone number of the bot in the README.md
